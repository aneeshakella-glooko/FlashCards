##Introduction

Presented here is an app to showcase my newfound React Native skills. I use the
knowledge gained from Redux in the previous course to assist in building the project.
This project is a simple  flashcards app. Basically, users can create different
decks, create cards for these decks, and then quiz themselves.

##Installation

To install and run the project
```
npm install
expo start
```

##Notes about Testing

Testing occurred on an Android device and Web Platforms. Testing on iOS did not
occur.

##Notifications

The app will notify you if you haven't tested yourself with the flashcards within
a day. The logic to implement this can be found in
```
utils/helpers
```

##Animations
Animations can be found when transitioning from the Decks View to a specific
DeckDetail View.
